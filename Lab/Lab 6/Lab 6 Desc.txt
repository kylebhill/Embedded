This lab I wrote a code to change the brightness of a LED using timer interrupts. For my code I used timer 0 to check the LED every 7ms the second timer had 300Hz frequency with a variable OCR2B based on the key pressed. Whenever 7ms passed I would scan the keypad using a similar function as in lab 3 which would change OCR2B based on a global array and the row and column values. Whenever timer 2 reached OCR2A the led would turn on and whenever OCR2B was reached the LED would turn off using interrupts. The only new thing introduced in this lab is setting the interrupts and calling ISR functions using those interrupts so everything works well.
