In this lab I wrote a code in order to brighten and dim an LED while a pushbutton was pressed. The LED and pushbutton are nothing new it is our use of a timer and duty cycle which is new to this lab. To set this up I first had to start the timer in CTC mode with a prescale value of 1024. Doing this I could set the period of the timer to be 10ms. The next part was to manipulate OCR0B when the button was pressed so that the duty cycle would increase. My program works well the only thing which I had issue with was when OCR0B hit 0 whenever this happened everything would stop working as intended to deal with this I first manipulated a variable and used an if else statement so that OCR0B wouldnâ€™t hit 0.
